 Once there was a rich merchant who had many ships
He bought and sold things from around the would.
 He lived in a big house by the sea.
He had three daughters. 
 the daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was the
most beautiful of all. In fact, she was so beautiful that
everyone called her "Beauty"
 Beauty was not only pretty but also kind and smart.

She loved reading. Her two sisters were not very nice though.
 They were selfish and greedy.
They liked to go to parties and to wear nice dresses.
Tjey were always mean to Beauty. They laughed at her when
she read books. They only thought about marring rich men.
